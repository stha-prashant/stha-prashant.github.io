I'm an electronics engineering graduate from Pulchowk Campus, IOE, Nepal. I work with [Dr. Binod Bhattarai](https://sites.google.com/view/bbinod/home) as a research assistant at NAAMII. I am interested in developing robust models in the presence of limited and/or noisy public data. My research primarily revolves around federated learning, self-supervised learning, multimodal learning and learning with noisy labels. I am currently exploring client selection for semi-asynchronous federated learning.

<b>Research Interests:</b> Federated Learning, Self-supervised Learning, Multimodal Learning, Learning with Noisy Labels
