I'm an electronics engineering graduate from Pulchowk Campus, IOE, Nepal. I work with [Dr. Binod Bhattarai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PDEi58sAAAAJ) as a research assitant at NAAMII, a reuptable research organization. I am interested in developing robust models in the presence of limited and/or noisy public data. Thus my primary research revolves around federated learning, self-supervised learning, multimodal learning and learning with noisy labels. 

<b>Research Interests:</b> Federated Learing, Self-supervised Learning, Multimodal Learning, Learning with Noisy Labels
